Dear Tech Support^ Last year I upgraded from Boyfriend 5.0 to Husband 1.0 and noticed a distinct slow down in overall system performance -- particularly in the flower and jewelry applications^ which operated flawlessly under Boyfriend 5.0. In addition^ Husband 1.0 uninstalled many other valuable programs^ such as Romance 9.5 and Personal Attention 6.5 and then installed undesirable programs such as NFL 5.0^ NBA 3.0^ and Golf Clubs 4.1. Conversation 8.0 no longer runs^ and Housecleaning 2.6 simply crashes the system. I've tried running Nagging 5.3 to fix these problems^ but to no avail. What can I do? Signed^ Desperate Dear Desperate^ First keep in mind^ Boyfriend 5.0 is an Entertainment Package^ while Husband 1.0 is an Operating System. Please enter the command "! http: I Thought You Loved Me.html" and try to download Tears 6.2 and don't forget to install the Guilt 3.0 update. If that application works as designed^ Husband 1.0 should then automatically run the applications Jewelry 2.0 and Flowers 3.5. But remember^overuse of the above application can cause Husband 1.0 to default to Grumpy Silence 2.5^ Happy Hour 7.0 or Beer 6.1. Beer 6.1 is a very bad program that will download the Snoring Loudly Beta. Whatever you do^ DO NOT install Mother-in-law 1.0 (it runs a virus in the background that will eventually seize control of all your system resources). Also^ do not attempt to reinstall the Boyfriend 5.0 program. These are unsupported applications and will crash Husband 1.0. In summary^ Husband 1.0 is a great program^ but it does have limited memory and cannot learn new applications quickly. You might consider buying additional software to improve memory and performance. We recommend! Food 3.0 and HotLingerie 7.7. Good Luck^ Tech Support,relationship-jokes,433,199,0.6851266

At last^ the long-awaited finale of the televised poem competition had arrived. The pope^ who was a keen lyricist and writer of poems^ had to everyone’s surprise entered the competition. He immediately announced that he would only be reciting poems about personal spiritual experiences. Despite this limitation^ it turned out he was gifted with words and he had made it all the way to the final. His opponent was the favorite to win: a Harvard linguistics professor on the top of his career and with a mind as sharp as a knife’s edge. The Harvard professor was up first. He was informed of the rules: "Two minutes to come up with a poem^ and it must involve Timbuktu." The clock started^ and when the time was up the Harvard professor approached the microphone: "On my way through desert sand Met a lonely caravan Men on camels^ two by two Destination: Timbuktu."

As far as anyone knew^ the pope had never been to Timbuktu^ which was soon confirmed by the TV commentator. How could the pope have a personal spiritual experience with such a word?! The elderly pope was walked to the stage and informed of the same rules: "Two minutes to come up with a poem^ and it must involve Timbuktu." The clock was started^ but after only a short thought the pope stopped it. Everybody in the competition had used all the provided time^ and as the pope approached the microphone a sigh went through the audience. Was he withdrawing from the competition? Would it all end in anti-climax? No^ to everybody’s surprise the pope started to recite his poem based on personal spiritual experience: "Me and Tim to Brisbane went Met some ladies^ cheap to rent. They were three and we were two^ So I bucked one^ and 'Tim-bucked-two.'",religious-jokes,291,105,0.7348485

Dear Tech Support^ Last year I upgraded from Boyfriend 5.0 to Husband 1.0 and noticed a distinct slow down in overall system performance -- particularly in the flower and jewelry applications^ which operated flawlessly under Boyfriend 5.0. In addition^ Husband 1.0 uninstalled many other valuable programs^ such as Romance 9.5 and Personal Attention 6.5 and then installed undesirable programs such as NFL 5.0^ NBA 3.0^ and Golf Clubs 4.1. Conversation 8.0 no longer runs^ and Housecleaning 2.6 simply crashes the system. I've tried running Nagging 5.3 to fix these problems^ but to no avail. What can I do? Signed^ Desperate Dear Desperate^ First keep in mind^ Boyfriend 5.0 is an Entertainment Package^ while Husband 1.0 is an Operating System. Please enter the command "! http: I Thought You Loved Me.html" and try to download Tears 6.2 and don't forget to install the Guilt 3.0 update. If that application works as designed^ Husband 1.0 should then automatically run the applications Jewelry 2.0 and Flowers 3.5. But remember^overuse of the above application can cause Husband 1.0 to default to Grumpy Silence 2.5^ Happy Hour 7.0 or Beer 6.1. Beer 6.1 is a very bad program that will download the Snoring Loudly Beta. Whatever you do^ DO NOT install Mother-in-law 1.0 (it runs a virus in the background that will eventually seize control of all your system resources).

Dear Tech Support: Last year I upgraded from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0. I soon noticed that the new program began unexpected child processing that took up a lot of space and valuable resources. In addition^ Wife 1.0 installed itself into all other programs and now monitors all other system activity. Applications such as Poker Night 10.3^ Football 5.0^ Hunting and Fishing 7.5^ and Racing 3.6. I can''t seem to keep Wife 1.0 in the background while attempting to run my favorite applications. I'm thinking about going back to Girlfriend 7.0^ but the uninstall doesn't work on Wife 1.0. Please help! Thanks^ Troubled User Dear Troubled User: This is a very common problem that men complain about. Many people upgrade from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0^ thinking that it is just a Utilities and Entertainment program. Wife 1.0 is an OPERATING SYSTEM and is designed by its Creator to run EVERYTHING !!! It is also impossible to delete Wife 1.0 and to return to Girlfriend 7.0. It is impossible to uninstall^ or purge the program files from the system once installed. You cannot go back to Girlfriend 7.0 because Wife 1.0 is designed to not allow this. Look in your Wife 1.0 manual under Warnings-Alimony/Child Support. I recommend that you keep Wife 1.0 and work on improving the situation. I suggest installing the background application "Yes Dear" to alleviate software augmentation. The best course of action is to enter the command C:\APOLOGIZE! because ultimately you will have to give the APOLOGIZE command before the system will return to normal anyway. Wife 1.0 is a great program^ but it tends to be very high maintenance. Wife 1.0 comes with several support programs^ such as Clean and Sweep 3.0^ Cook It 1.5^ and Do Bills 4.2. However^ be very careful how you use these programs. Improper use will cause the system to launch the program Nag Nag 9.5. Once this happens^ the only way to improve the performance of Wife 1.0 is to purchase additional software. I recommend Flowers 2.1 and Diamonds 5.0! WARNING!!! DO NOT^ under any circumstances^ install Secretary With Short Skirt 3.3. This application is not supported by Wife 1.0 and will cause irreversible damage to the operating system! Best of luck^ Tech Support,technology-jokes,266,139,0.65679014

Dear Tech Support: Last year I upgraded from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0. I soon noticed that the new program began unexpected child processing that took up a lot of space and valuable resources. In addition^ Wife 1.0 installed itself into all other programs and now monitors all other system activity. Applications such as Poker Night 10.3^ Football 5.0^ Hunting and Fishing 7.5^ and Racing 3.6. I can''t seem to keep Wife 1.0 in the background while attempting to run my favorite applications. I'm thinking about going back to Girlfriend 7.0^ but the uninstall doesn't work on Wife 1.0. Please help! Thanks^ Troubled User Dear Troubled User: This is a very common problem that men complain about. Many people upgrade from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0^ thinking that it is just a Utilities and Entertainment program. Wife 1.0 is an OPERATING SYSTEM and is designed by its Creator to run EVERYTHING !!! It is also impossible to delete Wife 1.0 and to return to Girlfriend 7.0. It is impossible to uninstall^ or purge the program files from the system once installed. You cannot go back to Girlfriend 7.0 because Wife 1.0 is designed to not allow this. Look in your Wife 1.0 manual under Warnings-Alimony/Child Support. I recommend that you keep Wife 1.0 and work on improving the situation. I suggest installing the background application "Yes Dear" to alleviate software augmentation. The best course of action is to enter the command C:\APOLOGIZE! because ultimately you will have to give the APOLOGIZE command before the system will return to normal anyway. Wife 1.0 is a great program^ but it tends to be very high maintenance. Wife 1.0 comes with several support programs^ such as Clean and Sweep 3.0^ Cook It 1.5^ and Do Bills 4.2. However^ be very careful how you use these programs. Improper use will cause the system to launch the program Nag Nag 9.5. Once this happens^ the only way to improve the performance of Wife 1.0 is to purchase additional software. I recommend Flowers 2.1 and Diamonds 5.0! WARNING!!! DO NOT^ under any circumstances^ install Secretary With Short Skirt 3.3. This application is not supported by Wife 1.0 and will cause irreversible damage to the operating system! Best of luck^ Tech Support,relationship-jokes,266,139,0.65679014

At last^ the long-awaited finale of the televised poem competition had arrived. The pope^ who was a keen lyricist and writer of poems^ had to everyone’s surprise entered the competition. He immediately announced that he would only be reciting poems about personal spiritual experiences. Despite this limitation^ it turned out he was gifted with words and he had made it all the way to the final. His opponent was the favorite to win: a Harvard linguistics professor on the top of his career and with a mind as sharp as a knife’s edge. The Harvard professor was up first. He was informed of the rules: "Two minutes to come up with a poem^ and it must involve Timbuktu." The clock started^ and when the time was up the Harvard professor approached the microphone: "On my way through desert sand Met a lonely caravan Men on camels^ two by two Destination: Timbuktu." The crowd went wild. Commentators were lyrical. This was without a doubt the best poem of the competition. The Harvard professor had done it again! But as the crowd settled down their spirits sank. As far as anyone knew^ the pope had never been to Timbuktu^ which was soon confirmed by the TV commentator. How could the pope have a personal spiritual experience with such a word?! The elderly pope was walked to the stage and informed of the same rules: "Two minutes to come up with a poem^ and it must involve Timbuktu." The clock was started^ but after only a short thought the pope stopped it. Everybody in the competition had used all the provided time^ and as the pope approached the microphone a sigh went through the audience. Was he withdrawing from the competition? Would it all end in anti-climax? No^ to everybody’s surprise the pope started to recite his poem based on personal spiritual experience: "Me and Tim to Brisbane went Met some ladies^ cheap to rent.

The "Buffolo Theory" of beer. A herd of buffalo can move only as fast as the slowest buffalo. When the herd is hunted^ it is the slowest and weakest ones at the back that are killed first. This natural selection is good for the herd as a whole^ because the general speed and health of the whole group keeps improving by the regular killing of the weakest members.

Excessive intake of alcohol^ we all know^ kills brain cells^ but naturally it attacks the slowest and weakest brain cells first.
